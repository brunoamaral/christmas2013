		<p>Every year around Christmas <a href="http://www.brunoamaral.eu">Bruno</a> comes up <a href="http://merrychristmas.brunoamaral.eu/">with something new to do</a>. It's his way of putting up a star, of sharing with others and of pointing a way. This year, for the first time, he asked his friend <a href="http://www.retorta.net">MÃ¡rio</a> for help.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of the usual idea for a Photowalk or a shiny yet boring christmas card, they went for Video. With little time and almost no margin for error, Bruno strapped a GoPro camera to his bike and cycled around the city looking to show everyone how it is during this time of the year.</p>

		<p>Mario took all the footage from that one trip and took care of editing it and try to give you a little perspective on it all.</p>

		<p>We hope you like it, and, <strong>Have a Merry Christmas</strong>!</p>
