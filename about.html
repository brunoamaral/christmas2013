		<p>Every year around Christmas Bruno comes up with something new to do. It's his way of putting up a star, of sharing with others. This year, for the first time, he asked his friend Mario for help.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of the usual idea for a Photowalk or a new shiny yet boring christmas card, they went for Video. With little time and almost no margin for error, Bruno strapped a GoPro camera to his bike and cycled around the city looking to show everyone how the city is like during this time of the year.</p>

		<p>Mario took all the footage from that one trip and took care of editing it and try to give you a little perspective on it all.</p>

		<p>We hope you like it, and, <strong>Have a Merry Christmas</strong>!</p>
